# Music Release

Created a music release platform in React. Pair project.

## The problem

Approached the problem by planning how to build the components in an organized matter. Did a lot of testing in the console on how to pull from a data that was imported form a JSON file.

We worked in branches and pushed through the terminal.

Projct constributors: Maria So and Kaja Wilbik
